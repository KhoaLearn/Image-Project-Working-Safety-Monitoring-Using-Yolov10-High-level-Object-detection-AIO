# Image Project: Working Safety Monitoring Using YOLOv10 High-level Object Detection AIO

## Overview

This project aims to enhance workplace safety through the use of high-level object detection powered by YOLOv10. By leveraging advanced AI techniques, we monitor and detect potential safety hazards in real-time, ensuring a safer working environment.

## Contents

- `ColabRun.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook to run the project on Google Colab.
- `docs/`: Directory containing documentation and related resources.
- `.DS_Store`: System file.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the project.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab (recommended for running the notebook)
- YOLOv10 pre-trained model

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KhoaLearn/Image-Project-Working-Safety-Monitoring-Using-Yolov10-High-level-Object-detection-AIO.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Image-Project-Working-Safety-Monitoring-Using-Yolov10-High-level-Object-detection-AIO
